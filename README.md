# AI-VIRTUAL-MOUSE
A gesture based virtual mouse which performs any controable commands on your device based on the gestures trained.

To replace the complete physical pointing devices used in computer systems and reduce the constraints placed by obsolete technologies like the mouse and trackpad, a virtual mouse is a system that identifies hand gestures or uses touch - free interaction.

The technique for creating a "Vision Based" real-time hand gesture identification presented in this project merely requires a camera and computer vision technology.

The suggested system employs hand gestures to carry out a number of tasks, including left- and right-clicking, free cursor movement, and up- and down-scrolling.

The proposed system can be used to control various soft panels like HMI systems, Robotics Systems, Telecommunication System, using hand gestures with help of python using pyautoGUI

module to facilitate interaction within different functions of computers through the Camera to capture video frames.
